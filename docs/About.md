# About guuu

:wave: Hello, I'm Darren Jennings, aka `guuu`. You can reach me on [twitter],
[github], or [linkedin].

I mostly blog about engineering things, but when I'm not talking about [Vue]. I
like to [brew coffee](https://www.thecoffeecompass.com/), practice Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu, spend time with my family, [nuclear](https://twitter.com/darrenjennings/status/1077663344767586304)
and [ecclesiastical](https://www.citizenssf.com/).

I'm currently Tech Lead at [Kong] where I lead frontend architecture, our Vue 
component library, as well as write cool stuff for our entirely Lua backend 
built on top of [Open Resty].

### Open Source

I like open source and am the author and maintainer of:
- [vue-autosuggest](https://www.github.com/darrenjennings/vue-autosuggest) an 
omnibox solution for vue apps.
- [kong-plugin-session](https://www.github.com/kong/kong-plugin-session) :cookie: 
Session plugin for Kong.
- [react-apiembed](https://www.github.com/kong/react-apiembed) a set 
of react componenets to generate code snippets from HARs.

### This blog :book:

I built this blog using [Vue's](https://vuejs.org) static site generator 
[Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). It's completely static (for now) and
you can find the source [here](https://www.github.com/darrenjennings/guuu.io)
