<Avatar header-text="About Me"/>

Welcome to my personal website. I'm Darren Jennings. You can reach me on
[twitter], [github], or [linkedin].

I blog about engineering things, mostly [Vue]. For hobbies, I like to
[brew coffee](https://www.thecoffeecompass.com/), practice
[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu](https://derbycitymartialarts.com/), and spend time with my
family, [nuclear](https://twitter.com/darrenjennings/status/1077663344767586304)
and [ecclesiastical](https://www.sojournchurch.com/).

I'm currently Tech Lead at [Kong] where I lead frontend architecture, our Vue
component library, as well as write cool stuff for our entirely Lua backend
built on top of [Open Resty].
