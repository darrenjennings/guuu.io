<Avatar header-text="About Me"/>

:wave: Hello, I'm Darren Jennings, aka `guuu`. You can reach me on [twitter],
[github], or [linkedin].

I mostly blog about engineering things, but when I'm not talking about [Vue]. I
like to [brew coffee](https://www.thecoffeecompass.com/), practice Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu, and spend time with my family,
[nuclear](https://twitter.com/darrenjennings/status/1077663344767586304) and
[ecclesiastical](https://www.citizenssf.com/).

I'm currently Tech Lead at [Kong] where I lead frontend architecture, our Vue
component library, as well as write cool stuff for our entirely Lua backend
built on top of [Open Resty].

### Open Source

I like open source and contribute/maintain some libraries. Some of my favorites:

  Request snippet generator for many languages & libraries
- [vue-autosuggest](https://www.github.com/darrenjennings/vue-autosuggest) an
  autosuggest or omnibox solution for vue apps.
- [kong-plugin-session](https://www.github.com/kong/kong-plugin-session)
  :cookie: Session plugin for Kong.
- [vuepress-plugin-reading-time](https://github.com/darrenjennings/vuepress-plugin-reading-time)
  a vuepress plugin plugin to display how long a post takes to read.

I built this blog using [Vue's](https://vuejs.org) static site generator
