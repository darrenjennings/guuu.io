In case you‚Äôre new to [Vue](https://vuejs.org), it‚Äôs an awesome javascript
front-end framework that makes writing reusable, testable UI components a
breeze! I
[recently wrote](https://medium.com/@darrenjennings/data-driven-vue-js-53e84f16e28f)
about how I love Vue‚Äôs data-driven design and second-to-none documentation.
However, I wanted to write about my experience with open sourcing my first Vue
component in the spirit of
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/darrenjennings).
Here‚Äôs what I found helpful traversing the mire.

## Before you begin, pick a component you already need!

It‚Äôs always a good idea to contribute to Open Source Software
[#OSS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OSS) by solving a problem that you
already have. As
[Max Stoiber says](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmxstbr.blog%2F2017%2F02%2Fcreating-open-source-projects%2F),
open source is a byproduct of solving problems. If you‚Äôre already building
reusable components, why not make them available for everyone and learn some
things in the process? If your components seem too tightly coupled to your
application structure, maybe it‚Äôs time to ask ‚ÄúWhat do I need to do to open
source this?‚Äù At Educents, we built an autosuggest component that would be
flexible enough to eventually abstract for general use cases while still solving
our real problems‚Ä¶ and then we open-sourced it!

## Grab a Template

Look at existing Vue projects for suggested structures for your github project.
Here are some mature projects we used as templates when writing a plugin:

* For plugins in the wild, checkout Algolia‚Äôs instant search component or Freek
  Van der Herten/Spatie‚Äôs vue table component
* For testing help check out
  [vue-test-utils-jest-example](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-jest-example)
* For general OSS project scaffolding, look at Kent C. Dodds‚Äô
  [kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts)

Of course you should also read the official docs for an overview on how plugins
in Vue work. If you‚Äôre already segmenting your UI library into prop-driven
components, then open sourcing a component isn‚Äôt much more than a simple
index.js script with an `install()` method.

Here is an example from a fictitious plugin called VueToAKill.

```js
import VueToAKill from './VueToAKill.vue'

const VueToAKillLib = {
  install(Vue) {
    Vue.component('vue-to-a-kill', VueToAKill)
  },
}

export default VueToAKillLib

if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.Vue) {
  window.Vue.use(VueToAKillLib)
}
```

## Build Your Vue Component for the masses

You need to get your component into a single consumable file. Webpack, rollup,
something else? Not much to say here except that I was familiar with Webpack so
I went that direction. It‚Äôs worth noting that Rollup seems to be more popular as
the Vue and React teams both use it to bundle their main libraries.

Webpack example partial config (full example config):

```js
output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "../dist"),
    filename: "[name].js",
    library: "VueToAKill",
    libraryTarget: "umd" // you can build for commonjs also
},
```

Naming the libary e.g. VueToAKill will give you the ability to reference the
library outside of a build tool, such as JSFiddle, or you can autoload the
plugin for users inside your install load (as demonstrated in index.js Gist code
block on lines 11‚Äì13 above). If you include it in a script tag, you can simple
load it into your Vue app like this:

```js
Vue.use(window.VueToAKill.default)
```

Once your lib is on npm, loading the plugin as a module in your build tools
(such as webpack), is as simple as installing and importing:

```js
import VueToAKill from 'vue-to-a-kill'
Vue.use(VueToAKill)
```

## Test Your Vue Component

Vue testing has a great library, vue-test-utils (recently migrated from the
popular lib avioraz), and it is being actively developed. While still in beta at
the time of this article, we found it worked well and gives you a testing tool
belt akin to Enzyme (for React ‚ù§Ô∏è), and can be easily integrated into existing
testing tools such as Jest or Mocha. It has shallow mounting of components, and
server side rendered snapshots for üì∏ snapshot testing. We even filed an issue
we discovered while testing and the maintainer responded within a few hours with
a commit fixing the issue.

Check out an example test on our VueToAKill component. I‚Äôm rendering the
component, and checking that the agents prop I‚Äôm passing is rendered in the
result Vue html with the desired number of `<li>` tags.

```js
import { shallow } from 'vue-test-utils'
import { createRenderer } from 'vue-server-renderer'

import VueToAKill from '../src/VueToAKill.vue'

const defaultProps = {
  agents: ['James Bond', 'Alec Trevelyan', 'M', 'Q'],
  licenseToKill: true,
}

it('can mount', () => {
  const props = Object.assign({}, defaultProps)
  props.licenseToKill = false

  const wrapper = shallow(VueToAKill, {
    propsData: props,
  })

  expect(wrapper.findAll(`ul li`).length).toBeLessThanOrEqual(
    props.agents.length
  )

  const renderer = createRenderer()
  renderer.renderToString(wrapper.vm, (err, str) => {
    if (err) throw new Error(err)
    expect(str).toMatchSnapshot()
  })
})
```

Try to aim for 100% coverage on vue component libraries since it is far easier
to obtain when writing smaller components and it gives your users confidence
beyond the stars and the retweets. I‚Äôll eat my own words though and tell you,
full coverage is a shibboleth of OSS, and promises little to the stability of a
project.

Getting full coverage shouldn‚Äôt be your goal, but more of a ‚Äònice to have‚Äô. Test
your code, for the reason that when the PR‚Äôs roll in, you can manage changes
more easily. Testing should help you make changes faster.

## Add Your Docs + Demo üìñ

Once you publish your package to npm, you can make it easier on your users by
giving them a playground to test it out. There are some great REPL‚Äôs out there
for playing with javascript such as jsfiddle, codesandbox.io, codepen, or
jsbin.com. The trick with using these editors is allowing your library to be
consumable from a `<script>` tag. Albeit, codesandbox has the advantage of using
a module loading via webpack so it‚Äôs more like a real-life app. You can utilize
npm package publishing sites such as the
<a href="https://unpkg.com">unpkg.com</a> CDN which will serve up any npm
package. In jsfiddle, you can add your unpkg url to the list of resources.

Also, go check out Storybook, which gives you a framework for building live
coding demos of all the iterations of your component. This gives your api an
easy playground for users to click through, and you can quickly see your
component in complex/different mutations. You can also debug components in
storybook, build it as a static site, and deploy it on your github.io page üíØ.
It‚Äôs the future, yo.

## Make it fancy üíÖüèª

Make it fancy, a.k.a. user-friendly. Your README.md is your landing page. Give
it a little love so that users have a good experience! Your readme should have
docs that are understandable, and clean. Think about a first time user who
doesn‚Äôt know exactly how to use or install Vue plugins.

* Explain WHAT problem the plugin is solving and WHY it stands apart.
* Create templates for what users/contributors see when they create
  [github issues](https://github.com/Educents/vue-autosuggest/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
  or
  [pull requests](https://github.com/Educents/vue-autosuggest/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
  by creating a ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md and a PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md in a .github
  folder in the root of your repo.
* Add
  [badges](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-write-a-javascript-library-adding-badges-to-your-readme)!
* Incorporate
  [Continuous integration](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-write-a-javascript-library-adding-badges-to-your-readme)
  like TravisCI

If you‚Äôre proud of your code, spend the extra time to help others be excited to
use it.

## üöÄ Publish to npm

`npm publish` it! At Educents, we actively developed our autosuggest plugin in
beta, consuming and refining it for our own use case, until we felt it was ready
for the world to be released for our public 1.0 release. So don‚Äôt wait to
publish, just give your README.md a big ‚ö†Ô∏è warning label if it‚Äôs under active
development, and make sure your version is in beta e.g. v0.0.1-beta.1

## Share it

Write a
[Medium](https://medium.com/@darrenjennings/open-sourcing-your-first-vue-component-5ef015e1f66c)
article, tweet about it, submit a PR to awesome-vue, share it with
[Sarah Drasner](https://www.twitter.com/sarah_edo) üòú. Why plug your own stuff?
Mainly because the more people that use your code, the better it becomes. Or at
least that‚Äôs the idea üòÇ If you have a cool component, tweet at me and I‚Äôd love
to check it out.

## Conclusions

What makes React so much fun is its popularity and inspiration in an ever
growing evolution of open source software. Vuejs is doing the same thing! It‚Äôs
proving to be a fun and testable framework for composing these reusable building
blocks. My hope is that you architect great things, no matter language or
framework you‚Äôre in.

If you enjoyed reading this, follow me on twitter where my DM‚Äôs are always open‚Ä¶
and of course go checkout
[vue-autosuggest](https://github.com/Educents/vue-autosuggest), and give it some
‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs if you like it!
